# Bank Marketing Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The analysis was performed using PowerBI for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the modeling was done using Python on Google Colaboratory, specifically a Decision Tree classifier.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts customer purchases using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Displayed the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.
Handling Missing Values

Identified columns with missing values.
Applied strategies such as filling missing values with the median or mode, or using other imputation methods.
Data Analysis

Conducted initial exploratory data analysis using MS Excel.
Performed advanced data analysis using PowerBI, creating various visualizations to understand the relationships between variables and customer purchase behavior.
Data Visualization

Created visualizations in PowerBI to gain deeper insights into the data.
Visualizations included purchase rates by demographic factors, behavioral data, and other relevant features.
Encoding Categorical Variables

Converted categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection

Selected relevant features for model training.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Model Training and Evaluation

Trained a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer purchases.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.
Key Learnings
Data Cleaning: Managing missing values and preparing the data is essential for building accurate models.
EDA: Understanding the data through visualization and statistics is crucial for feature engineering and selection.
PowerBI: Using advanced visualization tools like PowerBI can provide deeper insights and enhance the understanding of data.
Modeling: Decision Tree classification can effectively handle complex relationships in the data.
Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of the end-to-end process of data analysis and machine learning. From cleaning data to visualizing patterns in PowerBI and building predictive models, each step is crucial for extracting valuable insights and making accurate predictions.
