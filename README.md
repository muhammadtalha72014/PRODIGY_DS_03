# Bank Marketing Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The analysis was performed using PowerBI for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the modeling was done using Python on Google Colaboratory, specifically a Decision Tree classifier.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts customer purchases using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Displayed the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

### 2. Handling Missing Values

Identified columns with missing values.
Applied strategies such as filling missing values with the median or mode, or using other imputation methods.

### 3. Data Analysis

Performed advanced data analysis using PowerBI, creating various visualizations to understand the relationships between variables and customer purchase behavior.

### 4. Data Visualization

Created visualizations in PowerBI to gain deeper insights into the data.
Visualizations included purchase rates by demographic factors, behavioral data, and other relevant features.

### 5. Feature Selection

Selected relevant features for model training.
Split the data into training and test sets.

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation

Trained a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer purchases.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.
